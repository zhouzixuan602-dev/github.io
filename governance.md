# Governance & Ethics

This platform exists to support responsible, collaborative development of brain–computer interface technologies.

Governance here is **lightweight but intentional**.

## Core principles

* Openness by default, not by force
* Co-prosperity over zero-sum competition
* Respect for contributors across disciplines and regions
* Long-term trust over short-term advantage
* Responsible development of neurotechnology

## What this platform is not

* Not a marketplace for unverified medical claims
* Not a data dumping ground without consent
* Not a place for covert extraction of knowledge
* Not an authority or regulatory body

## Ethics in neurotechnology

BCI and neurotechnology intersect with:

* human agency and autonomy
* privacy and neural data
* safety and long-term effects
* unequal access and power asymmetries

Contributors are expected to:

* state assumptions and limitations
* avoid overclaiming
* flag ethical or safety concerns early

## Decision making

* No central authority for technical direction
* Norms emerge through usage and contribution
* Maintainers may intervene only to:

  * prevent harm
  * stop abuse
  * preserve platform integrity

## Conflicts and disputes

When conflicts arise:

1. Assume good faith first
2. Seek clarification and alignment
3. Escalate only if necessary

Persistent bad-faith behavior may result in removal from collaboration spaces.

## Evolution

Governance is expected to evolve as the platform grows.
Proposals for changes are welcome and should be discussed openly.

The goal is not control, but **stability that enables growth**.
